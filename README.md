This a short project to practice Hooks and a little bit of CSS.

It presents two bootstrap cards with a button in each one. Each card has a different logic and behaviour.

This way I'm exploring Hooks (useState, UseEffect and useRef), along side with bootstrap and form interaction. It is a kind of boilerplate.
